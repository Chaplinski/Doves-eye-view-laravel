There’s an in-person guestlist, which is close family and friends who will likely be able to attend the wedding, and if you are having a livestream there’s also a remote guestlist, which is everyone that would have been invited to the in-person wedding if circumstances were different. It is up to each individual couple to decide who belongs on each list, we can only offer insight and ideas from people who have been there too.</p>
