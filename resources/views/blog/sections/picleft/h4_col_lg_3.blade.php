Your remote wedding guests will truly be able to share in your big day, as you will have your own custom wedding livestream webpage, complete with a digital wedding program, so not a single one of your guests miss a beat. You also have the option to include the ability for remote wedding guests to leave Facebook comments directly on your wedding livestream page so that your remote guests can enjoy your wedding in real time together.</p>
