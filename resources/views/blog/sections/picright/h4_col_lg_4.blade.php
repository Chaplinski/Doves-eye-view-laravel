It’s no secret that some wedding videographers record in 4K these days, which is four times the pixel resolution of HD. However, due to the volatility of internet upload speeds and constant fluctuations in internet network traffic it is unlikely that anyone will be able to offer wedding livestreaming with a resolution higher than 720p HD anytime soon, at least without an astronomical price tag.
                            <br><br>With a wedding videographer you get a highlight reel and wedding video for later on, and with a wedding livestreaming service you get a still high quality video, immediately delivered to the eyes and ears of your friends and family. Friends, family, and even the bride and groom can watch your wedding ceremony a day, or even just an hour after the ceremony ends. We’ve had couples tell us that their family members who were in school or at work during their wedding ceremony were still able to watch the livestream a couple hours after the ceremony, making them feel included in their family member’s big day. Also, if you want to show off all of your wedding reception ideas and decorations to your remote guests then wedding livestream services might be more up your alley than a wedding videographer.</p>
