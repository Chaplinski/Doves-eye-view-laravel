Hiring a professional wedding livestreaming service that will work with you ahead of time and provide ideas and input will set your wedding livestream apart from the pack.</p>
                                    <p class="q">You probably wouldn’t be reading this article if you didn’t have friends and family scattered about who want to share in the beauty of your wedding, even from a distance. Imagine how touched your remote guests will feel that they can watch a broadcast of your wedding livestream in real time and share your special day, just like they had always planned.</p>

                                    <p class="q">Every family has their go-to tech person. You know, the person they call when their internet goes out or when their printer stops working. It is great having a person like this as a close friend or family member. Most of the time they are happy to help with all of your tech needs, but you need to know what it means when you are asking them to be in charge of your wedding livestream.</p>
                                    <p class="q">Most people think that when livestreaming a wedding online you just push record and go, and that’s true to an extent. If you just want to livestream to all of your friends on Facebook through your phone, then all you really need in a wedding livestream videographer is someone to hold your phone during the ceremony. </p>
                                    <p class="q">If you want a more private option then a YouTube wedding livestream can be set up so that only people with the link can view your livestream. This requires some finagling, though, and an experienced techie who hasn’t done any livestreaming before will still need to devote a few hours to calculating the ins and outs of how they can set up and share your wedding livestream with your remote guestlist (and only your remote guestlist). Your quality could depend on whether your tech person already knows how to livestream a wedding on youtube, and preparation could take anywhere from 15 minutes to 10+ hours.</p>

Someone who has never been in the hot seat might think it looks easy, and depending on the quality of wedding livestream you want, it might be. There’s also plenty of people who, if asked to run a simple Facebook wedding livestream, would feel too much pressure to perform. You would hate to find out too late that the person you put in charge of your wedding livestream does not perform well under pressure.</p>

Becoming a technology professional doesn’t happen overnight, and besides, why would you put your wedding at risk using anyone unprofessional? The lingering thought that someone unprofessional is in your line-up could weigh heavily on your mind at a time when you should be prioritizing other things.</p>
                                    <p class="q">There’s a lot of skills, knowledge, and confidence that only come from experience. Let’s say you want to have a YouTube wedding livestream and you have the perfect person to do it for you. Do they know that if they make a new account on YouTube for your wedding livestream that they can’t livestream for 24 hours on the new account? Did you know that if they just use their own account then after your wedding livestream ends your guests could be forwarded to the account owner’s other YouTube videos? These videos might automatically play to your guests after your wedding livestream ends, and Aunt Edna might not be too keen on the raunchy freestyle raps, political rants, or other content that could autoplay based on their YouTube channel.</p>

I can only speak to our personal experience here, but my wife and I got married on October 3, 2020. We had to change our plans so many times that, like most couples, we ended up being very fluid in what our actual plans were. We grew through this experience, and want to share the strengths we built with others on a similar path.</p>
