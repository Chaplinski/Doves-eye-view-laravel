                        <p class="q">In the past, a wedding livestream was perfect for destination weddings. Where only a small number of people could afford to travel to a destination wedding, adding a professional wedding livestream was the perfect way to make sure everyone was included, no matter what their financial or travel situation may be.</p>
                        <p class="q">These days lots of young people move from city to city, and in the process make a few very good friends who are also in the period of their life where they are experiencing life in several different cities. When sending out wedding invitations you are likely sending them to friends in multiple cities, states, and even countries. Much like with a destination wedding, couples who have friends all over the country and the world are rarely able to have everyone on their guest list actually make it to their wedding ceremony.</p>
