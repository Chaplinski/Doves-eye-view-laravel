When you have friends and family who have flown in from all over the country and world there is an expectation that you spend some time with every single one of them. Rather than getting pulled in a hundred different directions, Dove’s Eye View makes it so that you can share your wedding ceremony with everyone who is important to you, and then you can spend the rest of your day with your wedding party cutting a rug on the dance floor!</p>
