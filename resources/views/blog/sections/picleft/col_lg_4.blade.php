                        <p class="q">Being a wedding guest comes with obligations. The two biggest obligations are the need to request time off work and the need to save quite a bit of money for a long weekend to attend a friend or family member’s wedding. For people who can’t afford the time off or the travel expenses, having the wedding couple add a professional wedding livestreaming company to their list of vendors is a God-send. This means that people who really truly love the wedding couple, but have their own personal and work limitations, can still be included. Not only is this nice for the soon-to-be-newlyweds, but words cannot express the joy and relief that your loved ones will feel when they know they can watch you say “I do” in real-time from wherever on the planet they may be.</p>
                        <p class="q">Couples are initially bummed that their guest lists have been shrunk, but if you ask those same couples how their intimate wedding went most of them would tell you it was extra special because they didn’t have to spend their entire wedding making sure they talked to every one of their hundreds of guests.</p>
