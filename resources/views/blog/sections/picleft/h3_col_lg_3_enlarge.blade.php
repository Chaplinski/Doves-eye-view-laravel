Some couples send out a second set of paper invitations to their remote guestlist, but instead of including the physical location of their wedding they include the link to the livestream on these invites. They also include other details that might be important to their remote guest list. Other couples might decide that sending an email or direct message with their livestream info is the way to go.</p>
