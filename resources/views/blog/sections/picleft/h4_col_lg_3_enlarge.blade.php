Because you know these guests won’t be attending in-person, they clearly won’t need to know driving directions to your wedding venue or what hotel you are staying at on your wedding night. Use this option as an opportunity to get creative with the design of the invitation; match the font on the invitation to your wedding colors, use graphics of florals that will be in the real bridal bouquets, or include some favorite photographs of the soon-to-be-married couple.
